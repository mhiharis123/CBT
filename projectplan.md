I want to create a mini project where user can paste the order details in the input and the output will be formatted based on my format. 

You can refer to row 5 in @OrderList.csv, it shows available columns name.
Below that is all order details.

I want to build 1 web app where user can paste the order details in 1 row, then the web app will create another table clean formatted.

Because i only want the output to display certain columns i wanted.

The output must shown this column.

DR Code
Client Code
(Local)
Omnibus/GK Acc No
Order Date
GTD EXPIRY DATE
B/S
Market
Instrument Code
Securities/Stock Name
Order.QTY
Order.Price
Status
Done Quantity
Done Price

Followed by this wording below the table.
